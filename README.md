Developed an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API with vector-based document retrieval using LangChain and ChromaDB. The system performs semantic similarity search over PDF documents and dynamically generates context-aware responses grounded in source data.

 🔺Key Highlights:

Implemented document ingestion and chunking pipeline using PyPDFDirectoryLoader and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Utilized Sentence Transformers for embeddings and Chroma Vector Store for similarity search.

Integrated Gemini API for context-based answer generation with clean, formatted output.

Enabled traceable responses by displaying exact document sources used in each answer.

Overcame challenges like raw API output parsing and response formatting to deliver clear, recruiter-ready results.

🔧Tech Stack:
Python | LangChain | ChromaDB | Gemini API | Sentence Transformers | RAG Architecture | LLMs

Outcome:
Successfully built an end-to-end RAG system capable of understanding complex queries and generating accurate, source-linked answers — demonstrating hands-on expertise in applied generative AI and retrieval-based LLM workflows.
