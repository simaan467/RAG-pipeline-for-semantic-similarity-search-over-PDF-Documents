# RAG-pipeline-for-semantic-similarity-search-over-PDF-Documents
Developed an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API with vector-based document retrieval using LangChain and ChromaDB. The system performs semantic similarity search over PDF documents and dynamically generates context-aware responses grounded in source data.
